# Robot in Elevator Algorithm

- Move forward until you are inside the elevator.
- Turn until you are facing the button panel.
- Start at the "numbered button" for the highest floor the elevator can reach.
- For every numbered button, until the target button is found:
	- Subtract 1 from the "numbered button" count.
- If you reach the target numbered button:
	- Press the button.
	- Standby until elevator reopens the doors.
	- Exit the elevator when the target destination is reached.
- Otherwise:
	- If the doors open to a floor that is not the target destination:
		- Continue to standby until the target destination is reached.


# Real-Life Algorithm: Taking Out the Recycling Bins

- Wait until it is the evening before garbage day.
- Start the "recycling bins with content" counter at 3.
- Move to designated area in the garage where the recycling bins are located.
- For each recycling bin with content inside it:
	- Pick up the bin.
	- Turn right towards the main entryway to the driveway and move forward.
	- When outside the garage, turn right until the direction is facing the street exit of the driveway.
	- When 3 feet away from the street, advance 3 feet to the right perpendicular to the driveway and place bin down.
	- Subtract 1 from the "recycling bins with content" counter.
- Until there are no more recycling bins in the garage with content inside:
	- Return the designated area in the garage where the recycling bins are located and repeat the process.
- If the "recycling bins with content" counter is equal to 0:
	- Go back inside house.
