    <ol>
    	<li>They're cute</li>

    	<li>They're cure <em>and</em> adorable</li>
    	<li>They truly are man's best friend</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Are you convinced yet? If so, go find yourself a dog as soon as possible! There are a wide variety of different dogs, so odds are that one of them will be to your liking. There are:</p>
