<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The semantic tags not only separate specified lines of code into sections, but also indicate the nature of the data as well. Simply dividing them with <div> might work in some cases, but it risks the content to be confused for a different value than intended. Some of the ones I see as most important are the <nav> and <aside> tags, the former because they are important in the page's ability to navigate to other essential pages or sources, and the latter because it helps separate specified and/or unimportant data from the page's outline so as to keep the outline from being unneccesarily cluttered.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
For this page, the browser displayed the body's element tags in this order: <header>, <nav>, <main> (which contained <article>, <section>, <aside>, the second <section>, <h2> and <table> (browser added <tbody> in the lines next to both <table> tags) in that order) and <footer>.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I believe the biggest thing I've learned about Sublime was how to create and configure snippets for templates of frequently-used text. Doing this saves a ton of time by automatically producing lines of code you already know you'll need, such as the basic HTML layout elements or the structure of a ordered/unordered list. It would probably be good for me to make snippets of some layouts for things like forms or tables in order to save time from having to build them manually and/or having to look up how to make them.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I think figuring out how to create the snippets was the most confusing part of this challenge. Everything else was mostly familiar territory from last week's work, but the process of creating snippets introduced new elements that I had to learn from scratch and practice to implement correctly. In order to gain more understanding of snippets in the future, I'm going to have to do some hands-on practice in creating and utilizing them in actual assignments until snippets become second nature to me. -->
